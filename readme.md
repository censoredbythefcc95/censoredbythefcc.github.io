|Day 6| Present | Incomplete
## Project Description
This project reflects my personal portfolio and makes a first impression on my
future employers that will want to see where I stand with my work,
and how I stand from a visual perspective. Style and warmth are the key
highlights of what my project to resemble. I want to demonstrate that
colors, font and even spacing can make a big impact on how a website 
will feel and how a person looks at information when they visit my website.
## Google Sheet
Include link to your google sheet here.  Here is the sample [Joe had used in class](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15PmioBi2dQEkewpqI7MDkDpvcVF0Trw8vmarAQbwoHk/edit#gid=0) 
## Portfolio I want to Emulate
Search and compare at least 3 profile web sites.  Record your findings in the table below and include some aspect of the site that you would like to incorporate into your own site.
Link To Site  | One Thing I'd Like To Incorporate | 
| ------------- | ------------- |
| [findmatthew.com](http://www.denisechandler.com/) | 7C Colors and animations
|[caferati.me](http://jkeohan.com/) | Colors and design, how they feel warm|
| [jtom.me](http://mattfarley.ca/) |  Colors and how they pop on the website.

## Time/Priority Matrix 
[Link](https://res.cloudinary.com/jkeohan/image/upload/a_270/v1591621734/project1_matrix_ocy5gc_h1kg0m.jpg)
Include a full list of features that have been prioritized based on the `Time and Priority` Matix.  This involves drawing a a square.  In the middle of the square, on the x axis draw a line.  The most left part of the line should start with 0hrs and the end of the line should include 2hrs.  This line will be used to estimate how much time any one feature will take to complete. 
Now draw a vertical line on the y axis.  The top of this line should have `High` and the bottom `Low`.  This line will be used to assign a priority to to each feature you wish to include in the project.  
Now create a separate list starting with A and assign it one of the features.  Continue to assign each feature a letter.  Once complete add each letter to the matrix assigning based on what your feel it's prioirty is an how long it will take to implement. If any one feature takes longer than 2hrs to complete than break it down into smaller tasks and reassign them a new letter. 
Once complete tally up the time and determine how long the project will take to complete. Now break those features into MVP and PostMVP so you can guarantee you will have a fully functioning project to demo. 
### MVP/PostMVP - 5min
The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  
#### MVP (examples)
- Pull data using google json api
- Render data on page 
- Allow user to choose favorites 
- Save their choices in firebase
#### PostMVP 
- Anything else that is not MVP

## Code Snippet
Use this section to include a brief code snippet of functionality that you are proud of an a brief description  
```
const $div = $("<div>)
$div.addClass("Steven")
$div.text("Hello World) {
	// here is the code to create a div with the class Steven and text of "Hello World"
	//this is just text i practiced with that got me inspired to start this project
}
```
## Issues and Resolutions
 -Design - very picky with colors and spacing. Will need to decide soon.
 -Workflow- still very uncertain on how I will flow through my website. I get
distracted by JavaScript bugs pretty quickly.
-Timing: Honestly I have no idea how long the sessions for each task will take so I am giving myself more time than neccesary. I just want to get the tasks done by the days they are assigned in.
